# Issues

_Last updated: 2026-08-01_

Tracked problems found during review/QA that aren't simple TODOs (those live
in `HANDOFF_Document.md`'s "To do" section). One `##` section per issue.

## 1. API leak — GitHub secret-scanning alert (Firebase Web API key)

**Status:** Resolved / false positive — recommendation given, not yet marked closed on GitHub.

GitHub's secret scanning flagged the Firebase Web API key in
`public/live-viewer.html` (introduced via commit `b3b149a`):

```
public/live-viewer.html
    const FALLBACK_CONFIG = {
      apiKey: "AIzaSyAP16m8JzeIisHX1Wb0ImLGAu7AAHM4b-I",
      authDomain: "throttleiqfb.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "throttleiqfb",
      storageBucket: "throttleiqfb.firebasestorage.app",
      ...
    };
```

### Can this API key be used to do anything harmful?

Realistically, not much beyond what the app already lets any visitor do —
but there are a couple of real, low-severity risks worth knowing about.

**What it can't do:**
- It can't bypass Firestore rules or Storage rules. Firestore is
  owner-gated per collection (rides, bikes, maintenance, etc., with the
  audience-based sharing logic), and Storage (`storage.rules`) is
  auth-gated with owner-only writes. The key alone doesn't grant a token;
  someone would still need a valid signed-in `request.auth.uid` to
  read/write anything, and even then they're bound by the same rules
  every real user is.
- It can't read other users' private data. Public rides, public profile
  fields, and forums are already meant to be visible to any authenticated
  user by design — that's not a new exposure.

**What it realistically enables:**
- Someone could hit the Firebase Auth REST API directly with this key to
  script things the app's UI already allows anyone to do — sign up fake
  accounts, or trigger password-reset/email-verification emails to
  arbitrary addresses. That's more of a spam/cost nuisance (email quota,
  "denial of wallet" on usage-based billing) than a data breach.
- If any *other* Google Cloud APIs (Maps, Places, etc.) are enabled and
  left unrestricted on this same key in Google Cloud Console, those could
  be quota-abused too. This is the one thing worth checking directly in
  the console (APIs & Services → Credentials → this key → "API
  restrictions") — it isn't visible from the repo.

### Why this isn't a real leak

Firebase Web API keys are meant to be public — they identify the project
when making client-side calls, they don't grant privileged access on
their own. The exact same key is already visible to anyone viewing the
page source of the live `https://throttleiqfb.web.app/live/...` page
(Firebase Hosting serves it client-side), so committing it to the repo
didn't newly expose anything. Firebase's own docs explicitly call this
key non-secret; the actual access control is the Firestore/Storage
Security Rules.

### Recommendation

- Don't rotate the key — that risks breaking the live app for no real
  security gain.
- Do check the key's API restrictions in Google Cloud Console to confirm
  it's scoped to Firebase/Identity services only.
- Close the GitHub secret-scanning alert once confirmed (mark as "used in
  tests" / "false positive" or revoked-as-appropriate per your review).

## 2. Maintenance page highlighted the wrong bottom-nav tab

**Status:** Fixed 2026-08-01 (commit `221bb57`).

Reported as: _"the maintenance page from garage, when selected, shows that
I'm on record page in bottom but opens the maintenance page correctly."_

**Root cause:** `AppShell._tabs` in `app/lib/shared/widgets/app_shell.dart`
listed only the five tab paths. `/home/maintenance` is a shell route but
not a tab, so `indexWhere` returned `-1` and the code fell through to a
hardcoded `2` — the Record tab. The screen itself was routed correctly all
along; only the highlight was wrong.

**Fix:** the location→tab mapping is now an explicit, pure
`shellTabIndexForLocation(String)`, with a `_nonTabShellRoutes` map sending
`/home/maintenance` to Garage (where it's reached from). Matching is
segment-aware, so a future `/home/recordings` can't steal the Record tab.
Covered by `app/test/shared/app_shell_test.dart`.

**Watch for:** any *new* `/home/*` shell route that isn't its own tab needs
an entry in `_nonTabShellRoutes`, or it will silently inherit the same
wrong-highlight behaviour. The Record fallback exists only to guarantee
`BottomNavigationBar` a valid index.

## 3. Live-share sessions were world-listable (privacy hole)

**Status:** Fixed and deployed 2026-08-01. **Assume exposure occurred** —
see below.

`firestore.rules` granted `allow read: if true` on `liveSessions/{token}`.
The intent was "anyone holding the share link can view that ride." But in
Firestore, **`read` means `get` + `list`** — so any client, without
signing in at all, could enumerate the entire `liveSessions` collection and
read every rider's live GPS position, speed, battery level and uid. The
32-character token protected nothing against a collection listing; it only
made individual documents hard to guess, which is irrelevant once you can
list them.

**Fix:** the rule is now `allow get: if true` — `list` is not granted, so a
caller must already know the exact document id. Every real caller does a
keyed `.doc(token)` lookup (`public/live-viewer.html:378`,
`ride_recording_provider.dart:1032`), so no legitimate flow was using
`list` and nothing broke.

**Exposure assessment:** the project is pre-launch with only the owner's
own accounts, so real-world exposure is almost certainly nil. But the hole
was live on a public Firebase project for an unknown period, and live
location is the most sensitive data this app holds. Treat any live-share
session created before 2026-08-01 as potentially having been readable.

**The general lesson, worth remembering when writing future rules:** never
write `allow read` when you mean "anyone with the link." `read` grants
enumeration. Use `allow get` for link-shared documents, and grant `list`
only where a client is genuinely meant to browse a collection.

## 4. Live-session expiry could never have been reaped by a TTL policy

**Status:** Fixed 2026-08-01 (app-side); the TTL policy itself still needs
to be applied — see `HANDOFF_Document.md`.

The handoff doc has long carried a to-do to add a Firestore TTL policy on
`liveSessions.expiresAt` so expired share links auto-delete. That policy
would have silently done nothing: **Firestore TTL only acts on a real
`Timestamp` field**, and `LiveSessionEntity.toFirestore()` wrote
`expiresAt` (and `updatedAt`) with `toIso8601String()` — plain strings.
Documents with a non-Timestamp TTL field are ignored and never deleted, so
the policy would have appeared configured while reaping nothing, forever.

**Fix:** both fields are now written as `Timestamp.fromDate(...)`. Reads
accept either shape, so sessions written by an older build still parse and
a rider mid-ride during the upgrade doesn't get a broken link.
`public/live-viewer.html` was fixed too — it did `new Date(session.expiresAt)`,
which yields an Invalid Date for a Timestamp object and would have been
silently swallowed by the existing `isNaN` guard, meaning expired links
would have stopped expiring in the viewer.

**Still to do:** existing docs keep their string values, so they will never
be reaped even after the policy is applied. Either backfill them or accept
that the pre-fix rows linger. The `gcloud` command to apply the policy is
in `HANDOFF_Document.md`.

## 5. QA report

**Status:** Not started.

_No QA pass has been written up yet. When one is done (manual smoke test,
device walkthrough, or a scripted run), record findings here as dated
sub-sections — one per pass — rather than overwriting this placeholder._
