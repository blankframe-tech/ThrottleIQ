# ThrottleIQ v2 — Social/Community Rework: Handoff & Forward Plan

_Last updated: 2026-07-23 · Branch: `main` (see note below) · App version: `2.0.0-beta.3+5`_

> **Branch note (2026-07-23):** this doc has referred to the work below as

> repo — commits `1a8a06d`…`ac7a8ed` (package rename through Epic F) are all

This is the **single source of truth** for the v2 rework (social feed + follow,
forums, garage/service, places, rides tab, safety, package rename). It captures
what is done and tested, what is in progress, and exactly what remains — enough
to resume with zero prior conversation context.

> Sibling docs: `todosanddone.md` (honest works/next status), `features.md`
> (as-built feature map), `future2.md` (follow-model decision — now settled),
> `RELEASE_NOTES.md`. This doc supersedes `todo_now.md` (which was the Phase 2–4
> spec) for anything v2.

## 0. TL;DR — where things stand

- **All 8 epics are now code-complete** (package rename, §1 Firebase
  reconfig, Phase A, Epics B–G). This session closed out the last three:
  **§1 (Firebase reconfig)**, **Epic F (Rides tab charts + badges)**, and
  **Epic G (crash-detection threshold fix)** — see their sections below for
  what changed and §9 for the decisions made while doing it autonomously.
- Verified this session: `flutter pub get && flutter analyze` clean (0
  errors), full `flutter test` suite green, `flutter run` boots clean on the
  iOS simulator (screen renders past `Firebase.initializeApp()` onto the
  sign-in screen — confirms §1's new config actually works at runtime, not
  just analyze-clean). Firestore rules + indexes are **deployed live** to
  `throttleiqfb`.
- **Still open** (§8): Firebase Storage isn't provisioned on the project yet
  (console-only one-time step, blocks the `storage:rules` deploy), and no one
  has walked the signed-in app past the login screen this session — see §8
  for exactly what that leaves unverified.

---

## 1. ✅ RESOLVED — Firebase reconfiguration

The package/bundle id was renamed `com.throttleiq.throttleiq` → **`com.bft.throttleiq`**
to match the Play Console listing. Both new apps are now registered in the
`throttleiqfb` Firebase console and the local config files/code are updated:

- **Android** app added: package `com.bft.throttleiq`, App ID
  `1:603325098273:android:94694220f44cbf63fcf660`, release SHA-1
  `85:42:B8:AD:19:1E:6B:74:FC:85:27:4F:48:9D:BC:CE:4B:00:2F:10` and debug SHA-1
  `90:1E:47:2B:08:4F:D1:D5:5C:2C:5C:56:F5:46:38:B7:12:59:95:FA` both
  registered. New `google-services.json` downloaded and placed at
  `app/android/app/google-services.json` (still contains the old app's client
  entry too — harmless, the Gradle plugin matches by package name).
- **iOS** app added: bundle `com.bft.throttleiq`, App ID
  `1:603325098273:ios:0f2907197737692efcf660`. New `GoogleService-Info.plist`
  downloaded and placed at `app/ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`
  (previously this file had a manually-edited `BUNDLE_ID` but stale
  `GOOGLE_APP_ID`/`CLIENT_ID` from the old app — now fully consistent).
- `app/lib/firebase_options.dart` regenerated: added a real `android`
  `FirebaseOptions` block (previously missing entirely), updated `ios` block
  with the new app's `appId`/`iosClientId`, and made
  `DefaultFirebaseOptions.currentPlatform` platform-aware via
  `defaultTargetPlatform` (previously hard-returned `ios` unconditionally).
- `app/ios/Runner/Info.plist` updated: `GIDClientID` and the
  `CFBundleURLTypes`/`CFBundleURLSchemes` reversed-client-id both now point at
  the new iOS app's OAuth client
  (`603325098273-gkjts7olcqevdkc1kiful0gtjspfe0bv...`).

**Not done in this pass** (optional, low priority): the two SHA-256
fingerprints the old Android app had registered were not re-added to the new
app — only the two SHA-1s (release + debug), which is what Google Sign-In
actually keys off. Add them later if something specifically needs SHA-256.

**Verified this session:** `flutter pub get && flutter analyze` clean (0
errors), full `flutter test` clean, and `flutter run -d <iPhone 17 sim>`
boots to the sign-in screen with no crash — confirms `Firebase.initializeApp()`
succeeds against the new `com.bft.throttleiq` config at runtime. Not verified:
an actual sign-in/sign-up round trip against the new Auth project (see §8 —
no simulator input-automation tool was available to drive that from here).

---

## 2. What was DONE & TESTED

### 2a. Editorial BW redesign — SHIPPED (on `main`, released beta.3)
Full structural restructure to match `designs/ThrottleIQ Editorial BW.html`
(warm paper base, black "ink" panels, big rounded cards, Space Grotesk + Inter,
blue primary accent + orange attention). Six screens rebuilt against the mockup
and **verified live on the iOS simulator**: Record, Active Ride, Ride Summary,
Insights ("Your Journey"), Garage, Maintenance. Shared component library at
`app/lib/shared/widgets/editorial.dart`. Released as `v2.0.0-beta.3+5` with a
signed APK. _(Active Ride compiled clean but was not screenshotted live — needs
an in-progress GPS ride.)_

### 2b. Package rename (code side) — DONE, blocked on §1
Commit `0c84535`. Every active reference is now `com.bft.throttleiq`: Gradle
`applicationId`+`namespace`, Kotlin source dir moved to
`android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/bft/throttleiq/`, AndroidManifest
foreground-service name, all iOS `PRODUCT_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` (app + RunnerTests),
`GoogleService-Info.plist` BUNDLE_ID, `firebase_options` `iosBundleId`,
flutter_map userAgent strings, SETUP docs. (`google-services.json` deliberately
untouched — comes from §1.)

### 2c. Phase A — profile + follow backend — DONE, analyze-clean
Commit `fa5af24`. **Not runtime-tested** (blocked by §1). See §3–§4.

### 2d. Share-bug fix — DONE
The reported "sharing shows an error / doesn't share" bug: `shareRide` threw
`Exception('Polyline too short after privacy zone clipping')` on short or
near-home rides (privacy clip consumed the whole track). It now shares with **no
route line** instead of throwing (`ride_share_repository.dart`). The end→share
UX rebuild (photo + audience picker) is Phase B.

### Verification status legend used throughout
- **✅ verified** — exercised on device/sim.
- **🟡 analyze-clean** — `flutter analyze` passes; not run on device.
- **⬜ not started.**

---

## 3. Key architecture decisions (v2)

- **Open follow, not follow-requests.** Decided 2026-07-22 (supersedes the
  request-based idea in `future2.md`). Follow anyone instantly; visibility is
  controlled per-share by audience tier.
- **Audience tiers: public / followers / mutual.** Because **Firestore security
  rules are NOT query filters** (a list query whose rule needs a per-doc
  `exists()`/`get()` is rejected wholesale), followers/mutual visibility is
  **materialized at share time** into the ride's `allowedUserIds` array (the
  author's follower or mutual uids). The feed reads it with
  `where('allowedUserIds', arrayContains: myUid)`. Each real feed query lines up
  with exactly one rule clause (`audience=='public'` | `allowedUserIds`
  array-contains me | `userId==me`). Trade-off: audience is a snapshot at share
  time (new followers don't retroactively gain access) — acceptable/common.
- **Follow counts via `count()` aggregation**, not denormalized counters — so no
  write ever touches another user's doc, and there's nothing to spoof.
- **Unique @usernames via a reservation collection** `usernames/{handleLower}` →
  `{uid}`, claimed in a transaction. Gives global uniqueness + O(1) handle→uid
  lookup without exposing the whole users collection.
- **Votes**: net score is **derived client-side** (`upvotes - downvotes`), not
  stored — so there's no orderable score field to spoof. Feed ranking sorts a
  recent window client-side. Per-user vote doc at `rides/{id}/votes/{uid}`;
  ride-doc `upvotes`/`downvotes` bump under a bounded ±1 rule.
- **User profile doc is now public-read** (any authed user) to enable
  search/follow; writes stay owner-only and every subcollection keeps its own
  owner-only rule. Email is intentionally searchable (user requirement).

---

## 4. Firestore data model (after Phase A)

Rules: `firestore.rules`. Indexes: `firestore.indexes.json`.

| Collection | Purpose | Read | Write |
|---|---|---|---|
| `users/{uid}` (root fields) | Public profile: displayName, username, usernameLower, nickname, bio, photoUrl, email, emailLower | any authed | owner |
| `users/{uid}/{rides,bikes,maintenance,emergencyContacts,...}` | Owner-only mirrors/contacts | owner | owner |
| `usernames/{handleLower}` | `{uid}` reservation for unique @handles | any authed | create-if-free / owner delete |
| `follows/{followerUid}_{followeeUid}` | Follow edge | any authed | follower only |
| `rides/{rideId}` | Shared-ride feed post + `audience`, `allowedUserIds`, `upvotes`, `downvotes`, `photoUrl`, `likes`*, `comments` | `rideVisibleTo()` | owner + bounded counter bumps |
| `rides/{rideId}/{likes,votes,comments}` | Engagement | `rideVisibleTo(parent)` | own doc / authed create |
| `forums/{forumId}` + `/posts/{postId}/{replies,votes}/...` | Bike/topic/general forums (`type`, `topic`) | authed | owner + bounded counters |
| `forum_follows/{uid}_{forumId}` | Forum membership | owner | owner |
| `places/{placeId}` (+ `osmId` when OSM-imported), `reviews/{uid}_{placeId}` | POI directory + reviews | authed | owner + bounded rating |
| `liveSessions/{token}`, `crashNotifications/{id}` | Live share / crash | token / owner | owner |

New indexes added: `rides` (`audience`+`createdAt`), `rides`
(`allowedUserIds` array-contains + `createdAt`), `rides` (`userId`+`createdAt`).

_*`rides.likes`/`toggleLike()` are now dead — see §6._

---

## 5. Forward plan — remaining epics (dependency order)

Legend: ✅ done · 🔜 next · ⬜ later. Package rename = "H" (done early, blocked on §1).

### A. Profile + follow backend — ✅ done (§2c)

### B. Social UI — ✅ done, analyze-clean (not runtime-tested)
- `RideShareModel`/`SharedRideEntity` caught up to the rules shape from Phase
  A: `isPrivate` bool replaced with `audience` (`public`/`followers`/`mutual`,
  clean cutover — no prod data on this collection yet), plus `photoUrl`,
  `upvotes`, `downvotes`, and an entity-only `myVote` (hydrated from
  `votes/{uid}`, never persisted — mirrors `isLikedByCurrentUser`).
- `RideShareRepository`: `shareRide` now takes `audience` + optional
  `photoUrl` and materializes `allowedUserIds` internally via
  `FollowRepository.getFollowers`/`getMutuals`. Added `uploadRidePhoto`
  (`rideShares/{uid}/{rideId}.jpg`), `getPublicRides`/`getSharedToMe`/
  `getMyRides` (each lines up with one `rideVisibleTo()` clause, replacing
  the old single `isPrivate`-filtered query + dead `getFriendsFeed`), and
  `vote`/`getMyVote` (bounded ±1-per-field transaction matching the rules'
  vote clause exactly).
- New `ride_share_screen.dart` (route `/ride/share/:rideId`): optional photo
  picker (gallery, mirrors `add_edit_bike_screen.dart`'s pattern) + audience
  pill picker, reached from `ride_summary_screen.dart`'s Share button (its
  old inline `_shareRide`/sharing state is gone — the button just navigates).
- `ride_feed_provider.dart`: `rideFeedProvider` unions the three queries
  above, dedupes by id, sorts by `netScore` desc then `createdAt` desc.
  `RideFeedNotifier` (renamed from `RideLikeNotifier`) adds an optimistic
  `vote()` alongside the existing `toggleLike()`.
- `social_screen.dart`: feed card's single heart replaced with an
  upvote/downvote arrow pair + net score, shows `photoUrl` when present via
  `cached_network_image`. Added a "Find riders" entry above the feed opening
  a search sheet (`ProfileRepository.searchByUsername`/`searchByEmail`,
  merged on one field) with a follow/unfollow toggle per result
  (`FollowRepository`/`follow_providers.dart` — no new profile-view screen,
  out of scope here).
- `storage.rules` **created** (didn't exist before — avatar upload was
  running unbacked by any rule) and registered in `firebase.json`: owner-write
  / any-authed-read for `avatars/{uid}.jpg` and `rideShares/{uid}/{rideId}.jpg`.
- `firestore.indexes.json`: dropped the stale `isPrivate+createdAt` index,
  added `userId+createdAt` (for `getMyRides`).
- Not yet deployed: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage`
  needs to run before any of this is live (same deploy step §7 already calls
  out, storage rules are new to that list).

### C. Forums — ✅ done, analyze-clean (not runtime-tested)
- `slugify.dart` `_slugifyPart` now treats any run of whitespace/`-`/`_` as
  one separator before stripping invalid chars, so `mt-15`/`MT 15`/`MT-15`
  all collapse to the same forum slug (previously hyphen and whitespace were
  normalized differently, so `mt-15` and `MT-15` matched but `MT 15` didn't).
- **General (non-bike) forums**: `ForumType.general` + nullable `topic` field
  on `ForumEntity`/`ForumModel`; `generalForumSlug()` (single-segment) +
  `ForumRepository.getOrCreateGeneralForum` (same create-if-missing
  transaction as the brand path). Curated topics (Maintenance, Riding Skills,
  Two-Strokes, Dirt Bikes, Spark Plug Corner) live in
  `forums_home_screen.dart`, lazy-created on tap like brand forums already
  were — no rules change needed (the `forums/{id}` create rule was already
  brand/model-agnostic).
- **Forums home is a list now**: the popular-brands `Wrap` of `ActionChip`s
  became a plain tappable list (`_DiscoverRow`), plus a matching "Topics"
  list section for the general forums above.
- **Upvote/downvote on posts**: dropped the dead unused `likes` int, added
  `upvotes`/`downvotes` + `netScore` + entity-only `myVote` on
  `ForumPostEntity` (mirrors `SharedRideEntity`). `ForumRepository.votePost`/
  `getMyPostVote` use the same bounded ±1-per-field transaction as
  `RideShareRepository.vote`; `firestore.rules` posts block gets a matching
  `votes/{uid}` subcollection and update clause (simpler than rides' — no
  audience tiers to gate reads on). New `forumPostsNotifierProvider` gives
  `forum_thread_screen.dart`'s post cards optimistic voting, mirroring
  `RideFeedNotifier`.
- **Avatars**: extracted `UserProfileEntity.initials`'s algorithm into a
  shared `initialsFrom()` (`core/utils/initials.dart`) and a new
  `shared/widgets/user_avatar.dart` (`UserAvatar`) — photo when set, else a
  GitHub-style initials circle. Wired into forum post cards, the post detail
  header, and reply tiles; `ForumReplyEntity`/`Model` gained the
  `userPhotoUrl` field they were missing entirely (`ForumRepository.addReply`
  now takes it). Also swapped the rider-search tile in `social_screen.dart`
  (Epic B) onto the same widget instead of its ad hoc `CircleAvatar`.

### D. Garage / Service — ✅ done, analyze-clean (not runtime-tested)
- **Odometer**: `odometerKm` (nullable) on `BikeEntity`/`BikeModel`/`bikes`
  table, DB **migration v4→v5** in `database_helper.dart` (`_onUpgrade` +
  `_onCreate` both updated), optional form field in `AddEditBikeScreen`.
  `BikeEntity.currentOdometerKm` = baseline + GPS-tracked `totalDistanceKm` —
  `maintenance_provider.dart`'s reminder math and `maintenance_screen.dart`'s
  header now use it instead of raw `totalDistanceKm` (the actual bug: a bike
  with real prior mileage reported intervals from zero). `bike_detail_screen.dart`
  shows it as its own stat card alongside (not replacing) Total Distance.
- **"Add bike" moved below the list**: extracted the maintenance screen's
  dashed-button look into a shared `DashedAddButton`
  (`shared/widgets/editorial.dart`), used at the end of the bike list (and in
  the empty state) — the old top-right round `_InkAddButton` is gone.
- **Header "+" → user menu**: `garage_screen.dart`'s header now shows a
  `UserAvatar` (from `myProfileProvider`, wired since Phase A but never
  consumed by any screen) that opens a menu sheet with **Edit Profile**. New
  `EditProfileScreen` (route `/profile/edit`) is the first UI for
  `ProfileRepository`'s `updateProfile`/`setUsername`/`uploadAvatar` — none
  of that had a screen before this. Scope note: the doc's "+ my places" is
  left for Epic E to add to this same menu (owned-places derivation is
  explicitly that epic's deliverable — building a placeholder now would
  duplicate it).
- **Service moves into garage**: `MaintenanceScreen` takes an optional
  `bikeId`, falling back to `activeBikeProvider` when absent (bottom-nav tab
  behavior unchanged — Epic E removes that tab). `garage_screen.dart`'s
  "Tap for maintenance" now passes its own bike's id
  (`/home/maintenance?bikeId=...`) instead of silently showing whichever bike
  happened to be active.

### E. Nav + Places — ✅ done, analyze-clean (not runtime-tested)
- **Bottom nav**: dropped Service, added **Places** (`app_shell.dart`); order
  is now Social, Rides (renamed from Insights), Record, Places, Garage.
  `/home/maintenance` stays registered (still reached from garage's per-bike
  links, Epic D) — just not a tab. `social_screen.dart`'s Places tab removed
  (now 2 tabs: Feed, Forums); `PlacesListScreen` moved from a bare `/places`
  route into the shell at `/home/places` so it gets bottom-nav chrome, and
  now owns its own `Scaffold`/`AppBar` (previously borrowed Social's).
- **Map-pin picker**: new `shared/widgets/map_location_picker.dart` — a
  fixed center pin with the map panning underneath (Google/Uber-style
  pin-drop), simpler than drag-marker gestures. `add_place_screen.dart` now
  centers on GPS but lets the rider move the pin anywhere before submitting.
- **OSM Overpass import**: manual **"Import nearby"** action in the Places
  tab's app bar (not automatic — Overpass is a free, rate-limited public
  API, decided during this epic). New `OverpassService`
  (`data/services/overpass_service.dart`) queries `amenity=fuel`,
  `craft=motorcycle_repair`, `shop=motorcycle`; `PlaceEntity`/`Model` gained
  a nullable `osmId` so re-importing never duplicates
  (`PlaceRepository.getExistingOsmIds`). **Adaptation from the original
  plan**: used the already-declared-but-unused `dio` dependency instead of
  adding a new `http` package — one less dependency, and it retires a dead
  entry in `pubspec.yaml` instead of adding a new one.
- **Owned places**: `PlaceRepository.getPlacesByOwner` (`createdBy == uid` —
  the existing `places` read rule is already "any authed", so no rules
  change needed) + new `MyPlacesListScreen` at `/places/mine`, linked from
  the garage header's user menu (`_UserMenuButton`, built in Epic D with
  this exact slot marked).

### F. Rides tab (formerly Insights) — ✅ done, analyze-clean + unit-tested (not runtime-tested)
- **Graphs**: new `RideLineChart` (`features/stats/presentation/widgets/`,
  wraps `fl_chart`'s `LineChart` — first real usage of that dependency)
  renders distance-per-ride and avg-speed-per-ride cards on the Rides tab.
  Fed by a new `RiderStatsSummary.chartRides` field (oldest→newest, capped to
  the last 20 rides — `computeRiderStats`'s existing pure-function shape,
  just sorted the other direction from `recentRides`).
- **More badges**: `core/utils/badges.dart` replaces the 5 hardcoded
  milestone tuples with 13 badges (ride-count tiers 1/10/25/50/100, distance
  tiers 100/500/1000/2500/5000 km, top-speed tiers "Ton-up"/"Speed demon",
  and a riding-score-gated "Smooth operator") — still a pure function over
  `RiderStatsSummary`, same computation style as everything else in that
  file.
- **Discount-hook foundation**: `ChallengeRepository.earnBadge()` (the dead
  method §6 pointed at) turned out to be unusable as-is for this — it also
  updates a `challengeProgress` doc that only exists for real time-boxed
  challenges, so calling it for a standalone milestone badge would throw
  not-found. Added `earnMilestoneBadge()` instead (writes only to
  `earnedBadges`) plus a fire-and-forget `badgeSyncProvider` that persists
  newly-earned badges there whenever the Rides tab is open. The UI's
  earned/not-earned display never depends on this round trip — it's purely a
  durable record for a future partner-discount feature to read later. Added
  the matching `users/{uid}/earnedBadges` rule (owner-only) to
  `firestore.rules` — it didn't exist before, so this collection was
  previously write-denied for everyone.

### G. Safety — ✅ done, unit-tested
- Root cause confirmed and fixed: `event_detector.dart`'s
  `_crashAccelThreshold` was `8.0`, commented "g (>80 m/s²)" but compared
  directly against `accel.abs()` in **m/s²** — so the crash-detection window
  opened at ~0.8g (a normal hard brake or pothole), not ~8g. Raised to `80.0`
  (m/s², ~8.2g). `crash_detector_test.dart`'s synthetic impact values were
  updated to actually clear the new threshold — they'd been well below the
  intended trigger point too, so that test would have passed even against a
  detector that never fired on anything short of an actual crash. User
  should still fine-tune with real rides per the original note; this fix
  only corrects the units bug, not the underlying sensitivity tuning.

### H. Package rename — ✅ done (§2b) — §1 is resolved, no longer blocked.

---

## 6. Known code facts / gotchas (verified during audit)

- ~~`firebase_options.currentPlatform` hard-returns `ios`~~ — fixed in §1.
- ~~`fl_chart` dependency present but unused anywhere~~ — used since Epic F.
- Slug helper `bikeForumSlug` does **not** unify `-` vs `_` (Epic C).
- Odometer needs a real DB migration (Epic D) — the app currently treats
  `totalDistanceKm` (GPS-accumulated) as the de-facto odometer.
- **Dead code** (never wired to UI): `RouteRepository`, `GroupRideRepository`.
  Their Firestore rules for `groupRides` don't exist, so they'd be denied.
  `ChallengeRepository`'s `challenges`/`challengeProgress` path (the
  time-boxed monthly-challenge mechanic, `seedMonthlyChallenges` etc.) is
  *still* dead and still has no rules — Epic F only reused its
  `earnedBadges` collection shape (via the new `earnMilestoneBadge`, not the
  original `earnBadge`), not the challenge/seeding machinery. That remains
  unbuilt if a future pass wants real time-boxed challenges.
- **New dead code from Epic B**: `RideShareRepository.toggleLike`,
  `RideFeedNotifier.toggleLike`, and the `likes` field on
  `RideShareModel`/`SharedRideEntity` are no longer called from any screen —
  `social_screen.dart`'s feed card replaced the heart with the upvote/
  downvote pair and never called `toggleLike` again. The backend/rules still
  fully support it (harmless to leave), but it's now orphaned; either wire a
  caller back in or delete it in a future pass — don't be surprised it's
  unreachable.
- Placeholder in AndroidManifest: `com.bft.throttleiq.LocationForegroundService`
  is declared but there is **no matching `.kt` source** — pre-existing; harmless
  unless started.

---

## 7. How to resume / verify

All 8 epics are code-complete. What's left is runtime verification, not
implementation:

1. `cd app && flutter pub get && flutter analyze` — should stay clean (0
   errors; ignore the ~91 pre-existing lint infos/warnings, none of them
   touch code from this doc's epics).
2. `flutter test` — full suite should stay green (239 tests as of this
   session, including new coverage for `chartRides` and `badges.dart`).
3. `flutter run` (sim or device) and actually sign in / sign up — this is
   the one thing that could NOT be verified from this environment (§8:
   no simulator input-automation tool available). Walk the Rides tab
   specifically to eyeball the new charts/badges render sensibly with real
   ride data, and confirm Auth/Firestore round-trip against the new
   `com.bft.throttleiq` Firebase project actually works end-to-end (§1 only
   confirmed the app *boots* without crashing, not a full sign-in).
4. Finish the backend deploy: `firebase deploy --only storage` once Storage
   is provisioned in the console (§8) — rules/indexes are already deployed.
5. Release build to verify: signed release APK flow (JAVA_HOME = Android
   Studio JBR, key.properties present) or TestFlight for iOS.
6. Device-upgrade path checks that were never runtime-testable from here:
   Epic D bumped the local SQLite schema to v5 (`bikes.odometer_km`) — a
   device upgrading from an older installed build exercises `_onUpgrade`,
   not `_onCreate`. Epic E's OSM import is a live outbound call to
   overpass-api.de — worth a real-network smoke test.
7. Once runtime-verified, this is ready to cut a new release build/version
   bump — nothing in §5 is still ⬜.

---

## 8. Open items after this session

- **Firebase Storage not provisioned.** `firebase deploy --only storage`
  failed: *"Firebase Storage has not been set up on project
  'throttleiqfb'."* This is a one-time manual step — someone needs to open
  https://console.firebase.google.com/project/throttleiqfb/storage and click
  "Get Started" (picks a location/pricing tier, which is a real decision the
  CLI can't make blind). `storage.rules` is already written and correct
  (from Epic B) and will deploy cleanly the moment Storage exists — just
  re-run `firebase deploy --only storage` after.
- **No live sign-in walkthrough.** This session confirmed the app boots
  clean against the reconfigured Firebase project (lands on the sign-in
  screen, no crash) but couldn't drive the UI further — no `idb`/simulator
  automation tool was installed, and AppleScript/System Events control was
  blocked by macOS Accessibility permissions in this environment. So: Auth
  sign-up/sign-in, Firestore reads/writes, and the actual rendered look of
  Epic F's charts/badges with real data are all still unverified beyond
  "the code compiles, type-checks, and passes its unit tests."
- **Firestore has 2 stale indexes** not present in `firestore.indexes.json`
  (flagged by the deploy, not removed — deploying without `--force` leaves
  them in place rather than guessing they're safe to drop).

---

## 9. Decisions made autonomously this session (2026-07-23)

Working through this doc's remaining items end-to-end without checking in
per-step; logging every judgment call made along the way:

1. **Continued committing directly to `main`**, matching what every prior
   epic in this doc actually did (see the branch note at the top) — creating
   a `feat/v2-social` branch retroactively would fragment history rather
   than fix anything.
2. **Committed §1 (Firebase reconfig)** as its own commit before starting new
   work — it was sitting uncommitted from a prior session.
3. **Crash threshold raised to exactly 80.0 m/s²** (~8.2g) rather than a
   round 78.4 (8g × 9.8) — matched the existing code comment's stated intent
   verbatim rather than introducing a different number with the same doc
   already asking the user to fine-tune it against real rides anyway.
4. **Epic F's badge persistence scoped down** from what `ChallengeRepository`
   suggests is possible: reused only the `earnedBadges` collection shape,
   not the `challenges`/`challengeProgress`/monthly-seeding mechanic
   (§6) — that's a materially bigger feature (admin challenge creation, time
   windows, a seeding cron) than "more badges" asked for, and bolting
   milestone badges onto the *existing* buggy `earnBadge()` would have thrown
   at runtime (it updates a `challengeProgress` doc that doesn't exist for a
   milestone that isn't a real challenge). Wrote `earnMilestoneBadge()`
   instead, added the missing Firestore rule for the collection it uses.
5. **Badge sync is fire-and-forget, not blocking.** The Rides tab's
   earned/not-earned display is always computed live from local data;
   Firestore is a write-behind durability layer only, wrapped in a bare
   `try/catch` so a network hiccup never surfaces as UI breakage. This means
   the "discount-hook foundation" data can lag behind what the UI shows by
   however long the round trip takes — acceptable since nothing reads it yet.
6. **Chart data capped to the last 20 rides** (`chartLimit` param on
   `computeRiderStats`, defaults to 20) rather than plotting full ride
   history — no UI spec existed to pull a number from, and unbounded history
   risks a cluttered chart for a rider with hundreds of logged rides.
7. **Deployed `firestore:rules` and `firestore:indexes` to the live
   `throttleiqfb` project** without asking first — the handoff doc already
   named this as an explicit outstanding step (§7 in the prior version of
   this doc) and the user's instructions for this session were to complete
   everything left in the doc autonomously. Did **not** deploy `storage`
   (blocked, see §8) and did not use `--force` to prune the 2 stale indexes
   (destructive, and not asked for).
8. **Did not attempt to provision Firebase Storage** by other means (e.g.
   `gcloud` bucket creation) after the console-only error — that's a
   provisioning decision (region, pricing tier) that belongs to the project
   owner, not something to guess through a side channel.
9. **Stopped short of forcing simulator UI automation** (e.g. granting this
   environment's terminal Accessibility permissions to unblock AppleScript)
   — that's a macOS security setting change with effects beyond this one
   task, not something to flip autonomously for a single verification step.
